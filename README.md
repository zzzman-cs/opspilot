OpsPilot exists to proactively detect, report, and automatically recover from common operational failures in cloud-hosted applications, reducing downtime and manual intervention for small engineering teams.



# OpsPilot

**OpsPilot** is a lightweight, cloud-native operations platform designed to monitor application health, analyze system and application logs, alert engineers to emerging issues, and automatically recover from common operational failures.

OpsPilot is intentionally scoped for **small teams and internal platforms** that need reliable operations without a full-time SRE or expensive third-party tooling.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Small engineering teams often run production workloads with:
- Limited monitoring
- Incomplete alerting
- Manual log inspection
- Reactive incident response

This leads to:
- Late detection of failures
- Preventable downtime
- Engineers acting as “human monitoring systems”

OpsPilot addresses these gaps by automating observation, notification, and recovery.

---

## 🎯 What OpsPilot Does

OpsPilot focuses on **three core responsibilities**:

### 1. Monitoring
Continuously observes:
- Application health endpoints
- CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Service uptime
- Error patterns in logs

### 2. Alerting
Notifies engineers via:
- Slack
- Email

Alerts trigger on:
- Resource exhaustion
- Error spikes
- Service restarts
- Failed deployments

### 3. Automated Recovery
Safely handles common failures by:
- Restarting crashed services
- Rotating logs when disk usage is high
- Scaling application workloads when load increases

## 🧠 What OpsPilot Is Not

OpsPilot is **not**:
- A replacement for enterprise monitoring platforms (Datadog, New Relic)
- A business analytics tool
- An AI-based operations product
- A commercial SaaS offering

OpsPilot is an **internal operations platform**, similar to tools built in-house by many engineering teams.

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

OpsPilot follows operational best practices:
- Least-privilege IAM
- Encrypted storage
- No hardcoded secrets
- Automated backups
- Documented recovery procedures
- Cost monitoring and cleanup automation

---

## 🧪 Failure Scenarios Covered

OpsPilot is designed to detect and respond to:
- Application crashes

## 📈 Why This Project Exists

OpsPilot was built to demonstrate:
- Real-world DevOps decision-making
- Production-minded infrastructure design
- Automation over manual intervention
- Clear documentation and operational discipline

This project reflects how modern DevOps engineers design, deploy, monitor, and maintain systems—not just how they provision infrastructure.
